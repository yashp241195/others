This was my first project related to Computer Science (Dec, 2013)
3 programs 
  1. Contact creator : To generate contacts from CSV file to VCF format
  2. Folder Arranger : To arrange all files in their specific folders. 
                       I used to download lots of file so I create it
                       with mix of batch programming and C++. 
  3. Webpage Gallary : I was unaware of existance of languages like 
                       JavaScript and PHP so when I studied File Handling 
                       this was the first idea I had to build a language
                       which can create webpage dynamically because of
                       very limited availability of internet
